# Flutter Show Case

Flutter Show Case is a project I am putting together where I explore all the API features. The App consists of Micro Applications, where each one implements some of the unique and extensive features the flutter API has to offer. 

Implemented Functionality:

## The Home Page

This is a simple home screen that gives a list of all the micro apps to explore within the Show Case Application.

## Colour Changer

Colour changer is the first micro app I implemented. This was to get a feel of how the [documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/) reads and just how to structure a flutter application. The colour changer just gives the user the ability to change the colour scheme of the app.

## Scientific Calculator

The scientific calculator used a public RESTapi called [Newton](https://github.com/aunyks/newton-api), that allows you to send it a mathematical expression, where it returns the result. There are multiple types of equations the API can solve. Although, I only implemented Simplify, Derive, Integrate, and Factor.

## Paint

Very simple painting application. You can select a colour and draw with it. The idea in the future is to make it way more extensible realizable brushes, eraser, bucket tool and possible image import.
